\`[01]\` **Information we collected**
> We collect a small range of information that we use for analytical and functional purposes. This information is safely stored in private channels that only the bot developers have access to read.

The information we collect for these purposes are:\n
➟ Your server's name and ID, your username and ID, and the times/dates that the bot joined your server (and left, if occurred).

➟ Your server's custom prefix, if any is set using the prefix command.

➟ Your server's message content, for running consumed game feature.

We also collect the following information on specific actions:\n
➟ If you "spam" the bot or it's commands (repeatedly running the bot's commands, regardless of cooldowns), we store your ID, and the time/date, to be used for blacklisting purposes. We also log this incident to a private channel for bot developers to see. This information is only kept for 1 hour, until you are un-blacklisted.

➟ If you repeat the same action again after a temporary blacklist, we store your ID, and the time/date, to be used to indicate that you have been permanently blacklisted. We also log this incident to a private channel for bot developers to see. This information is kept permanently, unless you have appealed your blacklist and it is agreed to be removed.

➟ If you use a command that fails for one or more reasons, including but not limited to: permission errors, Discord API errors or errors originating from our own source code and implementations, we will log your ID, the time/date, the error that occurred, as well as the context, which includes the server and channel IDs if applicable. This information is only logged to a private channel for bot developers to see.
